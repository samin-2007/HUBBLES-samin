        it's true that many humans have dreamed of going to space for centuries. The idea of exploring the cosmos and discovering new worlds has captured the imagination of people all over the world. With the advent of space technology in the 20th century, this dream has become a reality for a select few individuals who have traveled beyond the Earth's atmosphere to visit the moon and even live and work in space aboard the International Space Station. The desire to explore and understand the universe around us remains strong, and many continue to work towards the goal of sending humans on longer journeys to explore and colonize other planets in the future.
        <br>
        The first human spaceflight was accomplished in 1961 by Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, and since then, many countries and organizations have sent astronauts and spacecraft into space for a wide range of scientific, commercial, and exploration purposes.</p>

    Mission Mars
</h1>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also called Mangalyaan,[a][11][12] was a space probe orbiting Mars since 24 September 2014. It was launched on 5 November 2013 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).[13][14][15][16] It was India's first interplanetary mission[17] and it made ISRO the fourth space agency to achieve Mars orbit, after Roscosmos, NASA, and the European Space Agency.[18] It made India the first Asian nation to reach the Martian orbit and the first nation in the world to do so on its maiden attempt.[19][20][21][22]
<br>
<br>
The Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted-off from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (Sriharikota Range SHAR), Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) rocket C25 at 09:08 UTC on 5 November 2013.[5][23] The launch window was approximately 20 days long and started on 28 October 2013.[6] The MOM probe spent about a month in Earth orbit, where it made a series of seven apogee-raising orbital manoeuvres before trans-Mars injection on 30 November 2013 (UTC).[24] After a 298-day transit to Mars, it was put into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014.
<br>
<br>

The mission was a "technology demonstrator" project to develop the technologies for designing, planning, management, and operations of an interplanetary mission.[25] It carried five scientific instruments.[26] The spacecraft was monitored from the Spacecraft Control Centre at ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network (ISTRAC) in Bengaluru with support from the Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN) antennae at Bengaluru, Karnataka.[27]
<br>
<br>
On 2 October 2022, it was reported that the orbiter had irrecoverably lost communications with Earth after entering a seven-hour eclipse period in April 2022 that it was not designed to survive.[28][29][30] The following day, ISRO released a statement that all attempts to revive Mangalyaan had failed and officially declared it dead, citing the loss of fuel and battery power to the probe's instruments.[31]

            On 23 November 2008, the first public acknowledgement of an uncrewed mission to Mars was announced by then-ISRO chairman G. Madhavan Nair.[32] The MOM mission concept began with a feasibility study in 2010 by the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology after the launch of lunar satellite Chandrayaan-1 in 2008. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh approved the project on 3 August 2012,[33][34] after the Indian Space Research Organisation completed ₹125 crore (US$16 million) of required studies for the orbiter.[35] The total project cost may be up to ₹454 crore (US$57 million).[13][36] The satellite costs ₹153 crore (US$19 million) and the rest of the budget has been attributed to ground stations and relay upgrades that will be used for other ISRO projects.[37]
<br><br>
The space agency had planned the launch on 28 October 2013 but was postponed to 5 November following the delay in ISRO's spacecraft tracking ships to take up pre-determined positions due to poor weather in the Pacific Ocean.[6] Launch opportunities for a fuel-saving Hohmann transfer orbit occur every 26 months, in this case the next two would be in 2016 and 2018.[38]
<br><br>
Assembly of the PSLV-XL launch vehicle, designated C25, started on 5 August 2013.[39] The mounting of the five scientific instruments was completed at Indian Space Research Organisation Satellite Centre, Bengaluru, and the finished spacecraft was shipped to Sriharikota on 2 October 2013 for integration to the PSLV-XL launch vehicle.[39] The satellite's development was fast-tracked and completed in a record 15 months,[40] partly due to using reconfigured Chandrayaan-2 orbiter bus.[41] Despite the US federal government shutdown, NASA reaffirmed on 5 October 2013 it would provide communications and navigation support to the mission "with their Deep Space Network facilities.".[42] During a meeting on 30 September 2014, NASA and ISRO officials signed an agreement to establish a pathway for future joint missions to explore Mars. One of the working group's objectives will be to explore potential coordinated observations and science analysis between the MAVEN orbiter and MOM, as well as other current and future Mars missions.[43]
<br><br>
On 2 October 2022, it was reported that the orbiter had irrecoverably lost communications with Earth after entering long eclipse period in April 2022 that it was not designed to survive. At the time of communications loss it was unknown whether the probe had lost power or inadvertently realigned its Earth-facing antenna during automatic maneuvers.[2</p>
